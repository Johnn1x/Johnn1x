# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Ivan, and my online nickname is Johnn1x. I'm from Moscow. I'm passionate about developing games in Unity and apps in SwiftUI. I'm not a professional, but I try to learn and improve my code. Sometimes, to speed up work and planning, I use neural networks, which is pretty effective.
