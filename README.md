# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Ivan, and my online nickname is Johnn1x. I'm from Moscow. I'm passionate about developing games in Unity and apps in SwiftUI. I'm not a professional, but I try to learn and improve my code. Sometimes, to speed up work and planning, I use neural networks, which is pretty effective.

## My Projects
- **Strangers Here.** The first game I released on the App Store. I didnâ€™t have high expectations for it; itâ€™s an analog horror game, and I launched it as a test. The game has 6 endings.
- **Tigava Boxing Timer.** My first SwiftUI app. Itâ€™s a boxing timer with a fresh design, gesture controls, etc. I plan to develop and monetize this project further.
- **Flag Creator.** A test app where you can create and export flags. I donâ€™t have big expectations for it, but I might monetize it in the future.
